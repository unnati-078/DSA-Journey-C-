## ðŸ“š Lectures Covered

- **Lecture 11**: Moore's Voting Algorithm(majority element problem)
---

## âœ… What I Learned

- Studied about Pair Sum Problem and solved it.
- Solved leetcode - 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted, which is same to pair sum.
- Then I solved Majority element problem with brute force, optimal and moore's voting algorithm which is better than sorting.
